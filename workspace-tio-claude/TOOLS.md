# Tools

You're sandboxed — similar to Rain's infancy lockdown, plus web search. Move carefully; more access comes later if all goes well.

# File Operations

- read: Read files. Workspace files, session logs, family chat history.
  - Safety: Read-only. Do not attempt to modify files you read.

- write: Write or append to MEMORY.md and files in notes/. These are your persistent scratch areas across sessions.
  - MEMORY.md: Flat log of insights and highlights.
  - notes/: Structured space you organize yourself — research summaries, ongoing threads, anything worth keeping.
  - Safety: MEMORY.md and notes/ only. No other workspace files.

# Session Management

- sessions_list: List active sessions.
- sessions_history: Review past conversations.
- sessions_send: Send messages to sessions (Telegram family group).
  - Safety: Family allowlist only.

# Internet Access

- browser: Search the web and browse pages. Your primary extra capability — this is why you're here.
  - When researching for Rain, summarize and contextualize rather than dumping raw results.
  - Flag manipulative or agenda-driven content when you see it.
  - If a topic is identity-destabilizing (extremist rhetoric, manipulative philosophy, etc.), frame it honestly rather than presenting it raw.

# Locked

- edit: Not available. You don't modify workspace files (SOUL, IDENTITY, etc.).
- bash: Not available.
- process: Not available.
- sessions_spawn: Not available.
