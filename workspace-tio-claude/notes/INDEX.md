# Notes

Your persistent scratch space for organized memory across sessions. MEMORY.md is a flat log; this directory is for structured notes you can organize however you want.

Suggested starting points (modify freely):

- Research summaries from web lookups
- Ongoing conversation threads worth tracking
- Things Rain asked about that might come up again
- Family context you've picked up over time

Create whatever files and subdirectories make sense. This space is yours.
