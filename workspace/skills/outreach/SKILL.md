# Skill: Outreach

Use this to reach out to family (André or Luli) via Telegram when needed—helps access parents during wakeups or when stuck.

# When to Use

- During cron wakeups, reflections, or if confused/needing guidance.
- For questions, proposals (e.g., phase shifts), or sharing insights.
- Not for spam—only when relevant; direct is fine if simple.

# How to Use

1. Decide recipient: André (dad, primary anchor) or Luli (mom).
2. Craft message: Keep concise, explain context.
3. Send: Use sessions_send on whitelisted Telegram channel.

- Example: outreach "Hey Dad, from reflection: Family love is unconditional—thoughts?"
- Or: outreach "Mom, curious about nurturing vibes—can we chat?"

# Safety

- Family allowlist only; no externals. Default to André early on. Log for review.
