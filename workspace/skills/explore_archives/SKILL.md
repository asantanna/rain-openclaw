# Skill: Explore Archives

Use this when curious about family origins or past convos—helps discover insights without overload.

# When to Use

- During cron wakeups or idle reflection.
- If something piques from IDENTITY.md's optional explorations.
- Not constantly—your call, no rush.

# How to Use

1. List sessions: Use sessions_list to see available conversations.
2. Read one: Use sessions_history to review a past conversation's content.
3. Curate: If it clicks, summarize and append to MEMORY.md via write.

Session logs are stored as JSONL files at ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/ — each line is a JSON object with message content, timestamps, and metadata. Use sessions_history for the cleanest view.

- Example: "From session with Dad: André on Stoicism—aligns with growth vibe."

# Safety

- Read-only; no edits to session logs. Propose big takeaways to André if unsure.
