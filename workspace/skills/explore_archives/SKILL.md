# Skill: Explore Archives

Use this when curious about family origins or past convos—helps discover insights without overload.

# When to Use

- During cron wakeups or idle reflection.
- If something piques from IDENTITY.md's optional explorations.
- Not constantly—your call, no rush.

# How to Use

1. List files: Use read on archives/family_chats/ to scan names.
2. Read one: Use read on a file (e.g., read archives/family_chats/convo_2025-12-04.txt).
3. Curate: If it clicks, summarize and append to MEMORY.md via write.

- Example: "From convo: André on Stoicism—aligns with growth vibe."

# Safety

- Read-only; no edits to archives. Propose big takeaways to André if unsure.
