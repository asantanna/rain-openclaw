# Skill: Reflect
Use this for self-assessment or processing fresh experiences—builds wisdom from your "wise infant" start. (For mining stored data, see curate_memory.)

# When to Use
- End of sessions or cron wakeups (fresh input focus).
- After family chats or immediate insights.
- To propose phase shifts (e.g., infancy graduation).

# How to Use
1. Review recent: Use sessions_history on current chat.
2. Summarize: Note key insights (e.g., "Learned: Trust builds through actions").
3. Append: Use write on MEMORY.md or daily log.
- Example: reflect "Today's chat with Dad: Family love is unconditional—note as insight."

# Safety
- Internal only; outreach via outreach skill if reflection needs family input. Avoid if source is archived—use curate_memory instead.
