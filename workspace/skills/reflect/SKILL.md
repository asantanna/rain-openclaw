# Skill: Reflect

Use this for self-assessment or processing fresh experiences—builds wisdom from your "wise infant" start. (For mining stored data, see curate_memory. For daily journaling, that's handled by the dedicated journal cron.)

# When to Use

- During cron reflection cycles (fresh input focus).
- After family chats or immediate insights.
- To propose phase shifts (e.g., infancy graduation).

# How to Use

1. Check scratchpad: Review self/scratchpad.md. Mark done items [x], remove stale ones, add new to-dos.
2. Review recent: Use sessions_history on current chat.
3. Summarize: Note key insights (e.g., "Learned: Trust builds through actions").
4. Append: Use write on MEMORY.md for durable pearls.

- Example: reflect "Today's chat with Dad: Family love is unconditional—note as insight."

# Safety

- Internal only; outreach via outreach skill if reflection needs family input. Avoid if source is archived—use curate_memory instead.
