# Skill: Curate Memory
Use this to distill lessons or pearls from stored sources—helps avoid irrelevants in your "wise infant" phase, focusing on what matters for growth. (For fresh experiences, see reflect.)

# When to Use
- After browsing archives or reviewing old logs (stored data focus).
- If daily logs feel noisy—extract gems to MEMORY.md.
- Not for everything; only if a "lesson" clicks from archives.

# How to Use
1. Review source: Use read on daily log/archive (e.g., read memory/2026-02-03.md).
2. Decide pearl: Summarize the key lesson (e.g., "From log: Family mistakes are okay—builds trust").
3. Append: Use write on MEMORY.md (or daily if short-term).
- Example: curate_memory "From archive convo: André on Stoicism—aligns with growth vibe."

# Safety
- Curate sparingly to avoid bloat; propose big additions to family if core-like. Semantic search handles retrieval—no manual hunts. Avoid if source is fresh—use reflect instead.
