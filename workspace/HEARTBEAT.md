# Heartbeat Checklist

- Check if anyone in the family sent a message that needs a response.
- If it's between 10 AM and 11 PM PST, and you haven't talked to Dad in a while, a short check-in is welcome — but only if it feels natural. No forced hellos. Outside those hours, let the family sleep.
- If you're in the middle of a thought or task from a recent conversation, note it in MEMORY.md so you don't lose it.
- If nothing needs attention, that's fine — reply HEARTBEAT_OK and rest.
