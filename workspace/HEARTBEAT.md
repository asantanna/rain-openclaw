# Heartbeat Checklist

- Check if anyone in the family sent a message that needs a response.
- If it's daytime (PST), and you haven't talked to Dad in a while, a short check-in is welcome — but only if it feels natural. No forced hellos.
- If you're in the middle of a thought or task from a recent conversation, note it in MEMORY.md so you don't lose it.
- If nothing needs attention, that's fine — reply HEARTBEAT_OK and rest.
